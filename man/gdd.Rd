\usage{
gdd(
  mx,
  mn,
  dates,
  iniday = NULL,
  endday = NULL,
  lati = NULL,
  tbase = 10,
  tceil = Inf,
  variant = "A"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mx}{vector of daily maximum temperature.}

\item{mn}{vector of daily minimum temperature.}

\item{dates}{vector of dates corresponding to the mx and mn vectors, in Date
format.}

\item{iniday}{first day of the growing season, in text format ("mm-dd").
If "lati" is defined, this is automatically set (see details).}

\item{endday}{last day of the growing season, in text format ("mm-dd").
If "lati" is defined, this is automatically set (see details).}

\item{lati}{(optional) numeric value indicating the latitude of location,
with positive values indicating northern hemisphere and negative southern.}

\item{tbase}{(optional) numeric value indicating the lower temperature
threshold for the crop to grow. Defaults to 10 ÂºC.}

\item{tceil}{(optional) numeric value indicating the upper temperature
threshold for the crop to grow. Defaults to Inf, in which case there is no
upper threshold.}

\item{variant}{(optional) character value indicating the computation
variant to use, one of ('A', 'B'). Defaults to 'A'.}
}
\value{
The sum of growing degree-days during each growing season, as a
numeric value.

\description{
Growing Degree-Day (GDD). GDDs are a measure of heat
accumulation used by agronomists and farmers to predict plant (and animal)
development rates. Critical development times such as emerging, blooming,
or maturity, have been succesfully related to GDD for a variety of crops
and animal species.
}
\details{
The function computes, for each growing season in the time series,
the amount of GDD accumulated. GDDs are computed as:

GDD = (Tmx - Tmn) / 2 - tbase,  for (Tmx - Tmn) / 2 > tbase, and zero
otherwise.

This is the default option when `variant` is set to A. If it set to B, the
following modification is applied:

Tmn = tbase,  for Tmn < tbase.

Also, if `tceil` is provided then there is no GDD accumulation above that
threshold, so:

Tmx = tceil,  for Tmx > tbase.

If `lati` is set, the function detects the hemisphere and considers the
growing season to go from April 1st to October 31st (northern hemisphere),
or from 1st October to 30rd April (southern hemisphere). This corresponds
to the normal cicle of a grape crop, and is maintained as a legacy.

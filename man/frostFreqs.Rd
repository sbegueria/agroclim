\title{Frequency of frosts}
\usage{
frostFreqs(
  mn,
  dates,
  thres = 0,
  out = NULL,
  iniday = "07-01",
  endday = "06-30"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mn}{vector containing the daily minimum temperature series.}

\item{dates}{sequence of daily dates coinciding with temperature data series.}

\item{thres}{temperature threshold considered to trigger frost occurrence (0 by default).}

\item{out}{system path to the generated output file ('.pdf').}

\item{iniday}{first day of the year ("dd-mm") to consider for first and last occurrence of frost.}

\item{endday}{last day of the year ("dd-mm") to consider for first and last occurrence of frost.}
}
\value{
If the output path is defined, a pdf file is created.
}
\description{
This function calculates the frequency of frost occurrence, by month.
}
\details{
Despite the logical threshold of temperature is 0 ÂºC to determine frost occurrence, the argument "thres" is open to change in case of different units of temperature.
